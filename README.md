#### Lambda School Build CS build week project

Originally, the backend was build using Django in Python. There were some difficulties regarding deployment and stability, so I decided to rewrite the backend in Vapor using Swift. There were challenges on both sides, but overall it feels like Vapor is much more robust and stable. Note that this is the first time I'd written anything using either framework, so I know there are major design pattern and practice issues with both of them, but they both worked in the end!

I'm quite enjoying the development on Vapor, so I'm going to keep building this for a bit.

Here's the forked [frontend](https://github.com/mredig/DungeonBattleRoyale-iOS) for iOS that points to an installment of this (Vapor) backend.
